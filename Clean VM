Example Cleanup Commands
Here are some example commands you can use to clean up specific areas:

Clean Jenkins Workspaces
bash
Copy code
# Clean up workspaces for a specific job
rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/<your_job_name>/*

# Clean up all workspaces
rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/*
Clean Jenkins Cache
bash
Copy code
# Clean up Jenkins caches (adjust paths based on your Jenkins installation)
rm -rf /var/cache/jenkins/*

# Clean up Jenkins logs
rm -rf /var/log/jenkins/*
Clean Docker Resources (if applicable)
If Docker is running on your Jenkins server or agent, Docker containers, images, and volumes may also consume disk space. Clean them up using Docker commands:

bash
Copy code
# Remove all stopped containers
docker container prune -f

# Remove all unused images
docker image prune -a -f

# Remove all unused volumes
docker volume prune -f
